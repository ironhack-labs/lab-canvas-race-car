### Iteration 4: Create obstacles

Now let's make this interesting. We should create obstacles that show up every specific amount of time.

They will always start in the position **0** of the `y` axis (the obstacles will be coming from the top of the canvas), but you should make them appear in a random place of the `x` axis.

### Iteration 5: Move the obstacles

For moving the obstacles, we need to update our `canvas` continuously. In this iteration, you need to continually change the position of the obstacles in every update, making them move down the road.

### Iteration 6: Points, points, points

Oh! If we want to challenge somebody, we need to quantify who is making it better. So we need to add a **score**. Go ahead and add a method to count points while you keep the car avoiding obstacles.
